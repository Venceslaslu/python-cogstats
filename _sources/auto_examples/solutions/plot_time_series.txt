Time series of conditions and scans
===================================
The aim of this exercise is to represent the time series of conditions
that the experimenter imposes on the subject.  It is important to get a
good picture of the shape of this time series, because this is the shape
of the modulation of the measured signal that we expect to see in brain
regions involved in the targetted process.

Basically you need to know in which condition the subject was when each
measurement was recorded.

The best way to make sense of the description of the experimental
paradigm is actually to get a pencil and a piece of paper and to start
scribbling, but here, we are going to do it with python.

Relevant information in the example:

- There is only one factor that the experimenter manipulates: the auditory
  stimulation, with 2 modalities : either ON or OFF.
- This auditory stimulation starts every other 42s and lasts for 42s. The
  experimental paradigm starts with 42s of rest, i.e. auditory
  stimulation OFF.
- There are 16 alternated blocks of 42s, thus 8 repetitions of the auditory
  stimulation.
