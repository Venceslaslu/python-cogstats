GLM fitting in fMRI
===================

Full step-by-step example of fitting a GLM to experimental data and visualizing
the results.

More specifically:

1. A sequence of fMRI volumes are loaded
2. A design matrix describing all the effects related to the data is computed
3. a mask of the useful brain volume is computed
4. A GLM is applied to the dataset (effect/covariance,
   then contrast estimation)
